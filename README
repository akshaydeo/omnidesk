OmniDesk: Your desktop everywhere is an RDP client written for Android operating system. This code is based on properJavaRDP. This code is developed by : Akshay Deo, Neeraj Joshi, Mayuresh Soni and Prasad Korhale (aplhabetically). We are not sure whether this build works or not but we aim to maintain this code to make it more powerfull and faster.

P.S. This was out academic project and was done when Android was in very early stage, so code is not with industry standards and not well documented. We expect to do this as we get time in future.
